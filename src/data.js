  aboutText:
   "As a front-end developer, I’ve spent the last several years building tools to assist informaticists and clinical subject matter experts in their decision making processes. I’ve worked hard to design and build systems that display information to healthcare professionals in a meaningful way.\r\nI have experience in back-end and full-stack development but found a home in the weird, wonderful world of JavaScript. I really enjoy the combination of logical and creative thinking. I find the detail work of CSS incredibly satisfying. I love to see the visual results of my work and feel a great sense of accomplishment when I complete a project. Working, collaborating, and learning with a team makes me a better programmer.\r\nI have a B.S. in Information Technology focusing on web development and UX design. I minored in English and have a love affair with literature. I’m working towards a certificate in music theory, harmony, and ear training. When I'm not writing code, I'm reading, listening to music, hiking, or playing with my dog.",
